- 👋 Hi, I’m @continental-ground-zero
- 👀 I’m interested in building utopian website with the core concept of "only for the INTJs (MBTI)".
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to start a project just like a github. starting from ground zero without getting any help from other easy platform based website builders to rule out the first principal.
- 💞️ I’m not looking for collaboration at this time, to protect the concept from the others.
- 📫 How to reach me is to send me an email.
- 😄 Pronouns: wow this is a thing now.
- ⚡ Fun fact: INTJ do not give a religion about fun facts for media. we seek greater goods.
